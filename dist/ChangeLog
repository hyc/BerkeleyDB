= Berkeley DB 6.0 Changelog =

== Database or Log File On-Disk Format Changes ==

The log file format changed in 12.1.6.0.


== New Features ==

Added an alternate storage format called blobs, which improves the read and 
update performance of very large data items. Interface available through
C, C#, C++ and Java APIs. [#19332]

Added several pragmas to the SQL layer that configure and give information on 
HA SQL applications, such as the number of sites in the replication group, or 
configuring election priority of a site. [#20227]

Added a BDBSQL_CONCURRENT_CONNECTIONS flag to the SQL API to allow database
locking to be disabled.  Useful when there are only readers in the 
database. [#20928]

When running Replication Manager in multiple processes, if the replication 
process quits and there is an available subordinate process, the subordinate 
process automatically takes over as the replication process. [#20969]

Added replication views/partial replication feature. Feature available
through C, C#, C++ and Java APIs. [#21062]

DPL enhancements to work with JDK7. [#21101]

Added encryption support for the Android JDBC driver. [#21129]

Applications which use snapshot isolation and long-running transactions will,
in many instances, see reduced use of the cache. This leads to improved 
performance by reducing the need for temporary freezer files. [#21324]

Added mpool stat fields st_mvcc_resued, st_oddfsize_detect and 
st_oddfsize_resolve to C#. [#21325]

Added support database partitioning in C# APIs. [#21474]

Added a per-thread cache for the locker struct which stores lock identifiers,
such as transaction ids or the locker id returned by DB_ENV->lock_id(). This 
can improve concurrency of programs which use 
DB_ENV->set_thread_count(). [#21591]

Port utilities to Windows Mobile. [#21636]

Expose 3 new repmgr stat values and a new DB_REPMGR_SITE flag value
to C# and Java APIs. [#21687]

Added support for localizing error messages in UTF-8 characters, and added a 
section about how to build localized library and an ICU example in 
Programmer's Reference Guide. [#21280] 

== Database Environment Changes ==

Redundant whitespaces are now ignored in DB_CONFIG lines pertaining to 
directories. [#20158]

Fixed bugs when attempting to open non-DB files as if they were databases.
If encryption was active, an assertion failure would occur. If encryption was 
not active, the error message "BDB0178 Encrypted database: no encryption flag" 
would incorrectly imply that a password was required.  [#21408]

== Concurrent Data Store Changes ==

None

== Access Method Changes ==

Fixed a bug that could allocate a heap data page in a region after the 
region creation has been undone.  [#20939]

Fixed a bug in heap that prevented it from working in mixed-endian 
configurations. [#21016]

Enhance the search performance for Btree access method when the keys share
a common prefix. [#21216]

Fixed bugs with the byte swapping of heap pages. Now heap databases can be 
moved between little-endian and big-endian architectures. [#21387]

Fix a race condition where a cursor in the process of being cleaned up could be 
accessed by another thread of control. [#21714]

Duplicating the position of a cursor on a partitioned database will no 
longer result in a crash.  [#22195]

Fixed an assertion error when closing a joined cursor. [#22398]

== API Changes ==

Change the sequence's cachesize and the delta parameter of DB_SEQUENCE->get to
be of type u_int32_t instead of int32_t. [#21552]

Fixed a bug with the DB_MPOOLFILE->set_maxsize API.  In previous releases the 
file was allowed to grow one page larger than the configured limit. [#21867]

Change the comparison function in DB->set_bt_compare, DB->set_dup_compare and
DB->set_h_compare to accept an extra 'size_t *locp' parameter. [#22235]

== SQL-specific API Changes ==

Added the PRAGMA large_record_opt, which when enabled can improve the read 
and update performance of very large records. [#19332]

Added support for multi-process access to the database in SQL HA 
applications.  [#21050]

In-memory databases can now be created without passing the flag 
SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE. [#21456]

Fix a bug in the SQL API where setting the page size to 64 K would cause an 
error.  Also fixed an associated memory leak in SQL online backup. [#21460]

Add bdbsql_log_buffer pragma to allow setting of log buffer size. [#21471]

Upgraded SQLite to version 3.7.13. [#21641]

Fixed a mutex leak with multi-prcess access to the database in SQL HA
applications. [#21714]

Fixed a bug that could cause jdbc build to fail on ARM-Linux using gnueabi 
gcc. [#22123]

Upgraded SQLite to version 3.7.16.2. [#22349]

Upgraded ADO.NET to version 1.0.85.0. [#22405]

== Tcl-specific API Changes ==

Support blob storage APIs in Tcl. [#19332]

== Java-specific API Changes ==

Fixed a bug where EnvironmentConfig.setCreateDir() was not correctly 
configuring the environment.  [#21127]

Fixed a bug where Database.verify() was not correctly configuring the 
db. [#22401]

Fixed a false error message that could be printed when creating a
transaction on a replication client in Java. [#21671]

== C#-specific API Changes ==

Clean up many C# build warnings. [#22285]

Fixed SWIG typemap defintions for C# interface. [#18509]

== Replication Changes ==

Fixed several assertion failures that could result when using failchk
and replication. [#19765]

Provide an error when the local site defined during internal initialization
is inconsistent with an earlier definition.  [#20870]

Fixed a bug where replication clients were incorrectly flushing the log
when the DB_TXN_WRITE_NOSYNC flag was specified.  [#20964] 

Fixed a bug where a valid invocation of the DB_ENV->repmgr_start() method
would fail after a previous invocation that supplied an invalid nthreads
parameter value.  A BDB3640 error was being incorrectly generated. [#21289]

Fixed a bug where the calculation of the number of required master lease
grants enforced that a transaction must be present on a strict majority
of replication group sites.  It is sufficient that a transaction be present
on at least half of the replication group sites, which in some cases reduces
the number of required lease grants.  [#21329] 

Fixed a recovery issue on the client where an incorrect checkpoint was being 
selected causing recovery to go to an incorrect point.  [#21342]

Fixed a bug that could result in a crash due to an incorrect re-request
on a site that just won an election.  [#21344]

Fixed a bug where logs would never get archived if there are 2 sites and 
various combinations of failures. [#21448]

Fixed a bug where we were not detecting the fact that DB_TXN_SNAPSHOT was being
used with an HA client.  Clients are by definition read only, so snapshot
transactions are not permitted. [#21601]

Fixed a bug where the determination of whether or not a site is peer was 
incorrectly determined. [#21722] 

Fixed a bug where a Replication Manager master could stop functioning
after accepting an obsolete group membership site list from another 
site. [#21804]

Reduce the multiple data streams that can sometimes occur if rerequest
times are shorter than the time it takes to switch log files or perform
a checkpoint at a client site.  [#21843]

Fixed a bug that a site is removed unexpectedly from the replication
group when the replication group loses the old master's confirmation
of adding the site during a master change. [#21875]

Fixed a bug where a master site could crash when removing a site if
the removed site closes its connections before the master completes
its final steps of the operation.  [#22050]

Fixed a bug where an election never happens after the loss of the master
when master leases are in use. [#22120] 

== Locking Subsystem Changes ==

Fixed a bug that could cause a trap if a lock timeout occured while opening a 
database. [#21098]

Fixed a hang which could occur if there were no more space for lockers. [#21774]

Fixed a potential race condition when building the deadlock detection graph
which, under rare conditions, might cause a invalid address fault. [#22261]

== Logging Subsystem Changes ==

Fixed a bug that DB_ENV->log_get_config did not work correctly when it was
called before DB_ENV->open. [#21359]

== Memory Pool Subsystem Changes ==

Fixed a bug in the DB_ENV->get_cache_max API that caused it to return an 
incorrect value and a bug in the DB_ENV->set_cachesize API that caused 
incorrect behavior when changing the size of an existing cache. [#21146]

Fixed a race condition occurring when trying to get information about a
file and the file is being extended by the OS. [#21193]

Corrected error messages in several memory pool configuration 
functions. [#21779]

Fixed several memory leak items identified by Purify runs. [#22283]
 
== Mutex Subsystem Changes ==

Fixed an undefined symbol error (MUTEX_IS_OWNED) when configuring with
--enable-diagnostic --disable-mutexsupport. [#21145]

Fix a bug where we were not properly aligning mutexes in DB_PRIVATE regions
when the application configured an alignment. [#21491]

Fix a race condition between DB_ENV->failchk() and the allocation of a 
mutex. [#21796]

Limit the default mutex spin count to be at most 200, to avoid excessive
spinning on systems with hundreds of hyperthreads. [#21463]

== Transaction Subsystem Changes ==

None

== Test Suite Changes ==

Added support for get/set_heapsize. [#21510]

== Utility Changes ==

Fixed a bug where calling DB->set_partition with a key array required users to 
keep the memory array valid until after the database was opened. [#18350]

Fixed a bug that caused DB_ENV->backup to stop early if DB_BACKUP_FILES was not set and a non-DB file was in the data directory. [#21076]

Fixed a problem with db_hotbackup's -F option, which could cause a 
segmentation violation. Also replaced an unclear error message. [#21184]

Fixed three problems with db_hotbackup's backup of transaction logs. A hot
backup did not use any configured log directory, but would try to open the
logs in the environment home.  The second fix corrected an error path, in
which the memory was freed by the wrong function, possibly causing a guard
byte error. The third fix fixed the issue that a wrong message would be 
displayed when only "-l" was specified. [#21313]

Fixed a spurious "No such file or directory" (ENOENT) error when running
db_archive in an environment with an empty queue database. [#21541]

Fixed bugs in compaction of large keys in the upper levels of btrees. [#21569]

Most  utilities no longer operate on replication clients which are being
automatically initialized. The DB_REP_LOCKOUT error is now returned. [#21593]

Fixed a resource leak in the db->verify() function for btrees. The bug would
slow down verification and possibly cause it to run out of memory. [##21917]

Removed a potential hang when compacting databases with many 
duplicates. [#21975]

Fixed a bug where we were not returning an error when trying to compact a 
heap database. [#22063]

Fixed a bug in the error handling of db_log_verify which would cause a
segmenation violation if there were not enough space to create its
temporary databases. [#22187]

== Configuration, Documentation, Sample Apps, Portability and Build Changes ==

Fix an odbc configure issue which was causing ODBC build failure with SQL 
API. [#21490]

Disabled encryption by default in SQL API on Linux, completed build
options for encryption in SQL and SQL JDBC on Linux, Windows and
Android, and updated build process for the three platforms in Installation
Guide. [#21872]

Use "-xO2" as the default optimization level for the Sun Workshop 
compiler. [#22057]

Fix an "opcode not supported" error on MIPS platforms whose assembler defaults
to the MIPS1 instruction set. [#22065]

Provide a consistent way to turn on/off encryption for db,sql,jdbc libraries
on Unix. [#22158]

Added the compile option CONFIG_TEST when using debug mode in the db_csharp 
Windows project, to be consistent with the db Windows project. [#22300] 

== Example Changes ==

Port the C bulk example to C++. [#19541]

== Miscellaneous Bug Fixes ==

Fixed a race condition that could cause a crash if 2 processes opened the same 
SQL database at the same time. [#21041]

Fixed an assert failure in the btree comparison function which caused memory 
to be allocated to the wrong thread.  [#21232]

Fixed a race condition in the SQL handle cache locking code.  [#21265]

Fixed a bug in the SQL code that prevented the table from being created when 
BDBSQL_FILE_PER_TABLE is defined. [#21417]

Fixed a bug that some fields of the partition key DBTs returned from
DB->get_partition_keys may not be initialized. [#21474]

Fixed a bug that prevented a sub-database from being created under the
directory identified in DB->set_create_dir. [#21603]

Fixed a bug where dbenv->mp_mtxcount was not being used correctly. [#21768]

Cleaned a few variable initialization problems that were causing failures on
64-bit Windows. [#21850]

Improved the randomness of the 20 byte unique fileid generator on Windows.
[#22470]

Fixed a possible assertion failure in the XA Transaction Manager feature.
[#22450]


== Deprecated Features ==

Tornado 2.0 is not supported, and VxWorks versions older than 6.9 are not
supported. [#21877]

== Known Bugs ==

Prepared transactions may not remove databases. An error EINVAL message will be
returned by TXN->prepare() if the transaction removed any databases.

Databases containing BLOBs are not portable between machines of
opposite endianness. 

The latest version of the ADO.NET driver uses a new database connection 
close function that does not clean up the database completely, leaving 
transactions active.  In our build projects that we distribute we
added the preprocessor definition INTEROP_LEGACY_CLOSE so the older
version will be used.   Removing this can cause hangs.

The db_log_verify utility does not currently implement support for the "-D" 
option. Also, the "-d" option does not work for an environment with multiple
databases. For environments with sub-databases, some unexpected warnings will
be thrown. [#22136]

Aborting a prepared transaction that removes a database or does operations on
a blob cannot undo the operations (although the call to txn->prepare
throws an error if a user tries to do that). [#22226]

Using the DB_FAILCHK flag with just the DB_RECOVER flag can cause processes 
to hang.  DB_RECOVER will cause the environment to be rebuilt, and when 
DB_FAILCHK is specified, it runs fail check as the last step in the open.
It is done afer the environment has been rebuilt.  There isnt anything for 
fail check to really do in this case.   The hang can occur if a separate 
process also uses this combination which would mean the environment is rebuilt
again and it could conflict with the first process if it is doing the fail
check. [#22419]

A rare race condition in the XA transaction manager can return the error
XAER_PROTO in a one-phase commit. [#22450]
