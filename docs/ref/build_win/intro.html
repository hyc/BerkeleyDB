<h1 align=center>Building for Win32 platforms</h1>
<p>
The build_win32 directory in the Berkeley DB distribution contains project files
for both MSVC4.X and 5.0:
<p>
<table border=1 align=center>
<tr><th>Project File</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td align=center>DB_VC4.mdp</td><td align=center>Visual C++ 4.0 project file</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>DB_VC4.mak</td><td align=center>Makefile exported by Visual C++ 4.0.</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>Berkeley_DB.dsw</td><td align=center>Visual C++ 5.0 project file</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>*.dsp</td><td align=center>Visual C++ 5.0 subprojects (compatible with 6.0
)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
These project files can be used to build Berkeley DB for any Win32
platform: Windows/NT, Windows/98 and Windows/95.
<h3>Building With Visual C++ 6.0</h3>
<p>
Open the file <b>Berkeley_DB.dsw</b>. You will be told that the project
was generated by a previous version of Developer Studio, and asked if you
want to convert the project. Select Yes, and all projects will be
converted.  Then continue on with the instructions for building with
Visual C++ 5.0.
<p>
Note that when you build a release version,
you may receive a warning about an unknown compiler option
<i>/Ob2</i>.  This is apparently a flaw in the project conversion
for Visual C++ and can be ignored.
<h3>Building With Visual C++ 5.0</h3>
<p>
Open the file <b>Berkeley_DB.dsw</b>.  This workspace includes a number
of subprojects needed to build Berkeley DB.
<p>
First, you'll need to set the include directories.  To do this, select
<i>Options...</i> from the <i>Tools</i> pull-down menu. At this
point, a tabbed dialogue should appear.  In this new window, choose the
<i>Directories</i> tab. For the <i>Platform</i>, select
<i>Win32</i> and for <i>Show directories for</i> select
<i>Include files</i>.  Below these options in the list of directories,
you should add two directories: the full pathname of the
<i>build_win32</i> subdirectory of Berkeley DB, followed by the full
pathname of the <i>include</i> subdirectory of Berkeley DB. Then click OK.
<p>
Then, select <i>Active Project Configuration</i> under the
<i>Build</i> pull-down menu.  For a debug version of the libraries,
tools and examples, select <i>db_buildall - Win32 Debug</i>.  For a
release version, select <i>db_buildall - Win32 Release</i>. Finally,
to build, select <i>Build db_buildall.exe</i> under the
<i>Build</i> pull-down menu.
<p>
When building your application, you should normally use compile options
"debug multithreaded dll" and link against
<b>build_win32/Debug/libdb30d.lib</b>.  If you want to link against a
static (non-DLL) version of the library, use the "debug multithreaded"
compile options and link against <b>build_win32/Debug/libdb30sd.lib</b>.
You can also build a release version of the libraries and tools, which
will be placed in <b>build_win32/Release/libdb30.lib</b>. The static
version will be in <b>build_win32/Release/libdb30s.lib</b>.
<h3>Building With Visual C++ 4.x</h3>
<p>
First move your distribution directory to <b>\db</b> (so that the
project file is <b>\db\build_win32\DB_VC4.mdp</b> for some drive
letter). Then open the file <b>DB_VC4.mdp</b>. The 4.X project files
currently allow you to build only the DLL version of libdb. First, you'll
need to set the include directories.  To do this, select
<i>Options...</i> from the <i>Tools</i> pull-down menu.  At this
point, a tabbed dialogue should appear. In this new window, choose the
<i>Directories</i> tab. For the <i>Platform</i>, select
<i>Win32</i> and for <i>Show directories for</i> select
<i>Include files</i>.  Below these options in the list of directories,
you should add two directories:  <b>/db/build_win32</b> followed by the
<b>/db/include</b> directory, and select OK.  You can now build the DLL.
<h3>Including the C++ API</h3>
<p>
C++ support is built automatically on Win32.
<h3>Including the Java API</h3>
<p>
Java support is not built automatically.  The following instructions
assume you have installed the Sun Java Development Kit in
<b>d:/java</b>.  Of course, if you've installed elsewhere, or have
different Java software, you will need to adjust the pathnames
accordingly.  First, use the instructions above for Visual C++ 5.0 or 6.0
to open the Tools/Options tabbed dialog for adding include directories.
In addition to the directories specified above, add
<b>d:/java/include</b> and <b>d:/java/include/win32</b>.  These are
the directories needed when including <b>jni.h</b>.  Now, before
clicking OK, under <i>Show directories for</i>, choose
<i>Executable files</i>.  Add <b>d:/java/bin</b>.  That directory
is needed to find javac.  Now select OK.
<p>
Select <i>Active Project Configuration</i> under the <i>Build</i>
pull-down menu.  Choose <i>db_java - Win32 Release</i>. To build,
select <i>Build libdb_java30.dll</i> under the <i>Build</i>
pull-down menu.  This builds the Java support library for Berkeley DB and
compiles all the java files, placing the class files in the
<b>java/classes</b> subdirectory of Berkeley DB.  Set your environment
variable CLASSPATH to include this directory, your environment variable
PATH to include the <b>build_win32/Release</b> subdirectory, and as a
test, try running the command
<blockquote><pre>java com.sleepycat.examples.AccessExample</pre></blockquote>
<h3>Including the Tcl API</h3>
<p>
Tcl support is not built automatically.  The following instructions assume
you have installed Tcl8.x in <b>d:/tcl</b>.  Of course, if you've
installed Tcl elsewhere, or have different software, you will need to
adjust the pathnames accordingly.  First, use the instructions above for
Visual C++ 5.0 or 6.0 to open the <i>Tools/Options</i> tabbed dialog
for adding include directories.  In addition to the directories specified
above, add <b>d:/tcl/include</b>.  This is the directory that contains
<b>tcl.h</b>.  Now select OK.
<p>
Select <i>Active Project Configuration</i> under the <i>Build</i>
pull-down menu.  Choose <i>db_tcl - Win32 Release</i>. To build,
select <i>Build libdb_tcl30.dll</i> under the <i>Build</i>
pull-down menu.  This builds the Tcl support library for Berkeley DB, placing
the result into <b>build_win32/Release/libdb_tcl30.dll</b>.
