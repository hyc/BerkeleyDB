<h1 align=center>Java Programming Notes</h1>
<p>The Java API closely parallels the Berkeley DB C++ interface, and to a great
degree, the Berkeley DB C interface.  If you are currently using either of those
APIs, there will be very little to surprise you in the Java API.  We have
even taken care to make the names of classes, constants, methods and
arguments identical, where possible, across all three APIs.
<p>If there are embedded null strings in the <b>db_config</b> argument for
<a href="../../api_java/env_open.html">DbEnv.open</a>, they will be treated as the end of the list of config
strings, even though you may have allocated a longer array.  Fill in all
the strings in your array unless you intend to cut it short.  This same
comment applies to the <b>curslist</b> argument for <a href="../../api_java/db_join.html">Db.join</a>.
<p>The callback installed for <a href="../../api_java/env_set_errcall.html">DbEnv.set_errcall</a> will run in the same
thread as the caller to <a href="../../api_java/env_set_errcall.html">DbEnv.set_errcall</a>.  Make sure that thread
remains running until your application exits or <a href="../../api_java/env_close.html">DbEnv.close</a> is
called.
<p>The Berkeley DB package requires that you explicitly call close on each
individual <a href="../../api_java/db_class.html">Db</a> and <a href="../../api_java/dbc_class.html">Dbc</a> object that you obtained.  Your
database activity may not be synchronized to disk unless you do so.
<p>There is no class corresponding to the C++ DbMpoolFile class in the Berkeley DB
Java API.  There is a subset of the memp_XXX methods in the <a href="../../api_java/dbenv_class.html">DbEnv</a>
class.  This has been provided to allow you to perform certain
administrative actions on underlying memory pools opened as a consequence
of <a href="../../api_java/env_open.html">DbEnv.open</a>.  Direct access to other memory pool functionality
is not appropriate for the Java environment.
<p>The Java runtime does not automatically close Db* objects on finalization.
There are a couple reasons for this.  One is that finalization is
generally run only when garbage collection occurs and there is no
guarantee that this occurs at all, even on exit.  Allowing specific Berkeley DB
actions to occur in ways that cannot be replicated seems wrong.  Secondly,
finalization of objects may happen in an arbitrary order, so we would have
to do extra bookkeeping to make sure everything was closed in the proper
order.  The best word of advice is to always do a close() for any matching
open() call.
<p>Berkeley DB always turns on the <a href="../../api_java/env_open.html#DB_THREAD">Db.DB_THREAD</a> flag since threads
are expected in Java.
<p>Many methods in the API often have no return type, and throw a
<a href="../../api_java/except_class.html">DbException</a> when an severe error arises.  There are some notable
methods that do have a return value, and can also throw an exception.
<a href="../../api_java/db_get.html">Db.get</a> and <a href="../../api_java/dbc_get.html">Dbc.get</a> both return 0 when a get succeeds,
<a href="../../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_NOTFOUND">Db.DB_NOTFOUND</a> when the key is not found, and throw an error when
there is a severe error.  There are others.  This allows the programmer
to check for typical data driven errors by watching return values without
special casing exceptions.  An object of type
<a href="../../api_java/runrec_class.html">DbRunRecoveryException</a>, a subclass of <a href="../../api_java/except_class.html">DbException</a>, is
thrown when there is an error that requires a recovery of the database,
using <a href="../../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a>.
<p>An object of type <a href="../../api_java/mem_class.html">DbMemoryException</a> is thrown when the system
cannot provide enough memory to complete the operation (ENOMEM on UNIX).
See the JAVA API interface documentation for specific details.
<p>An object of type <a href="../../api_java/deadlock_class.html">DbDeadlockException</a> is thrown when a deadlock
would occur.  See the JAVA API interface documentation for specific details.
