<h3 align=center>Interface Changes introduced in DB 2.3.10:</h3>

<ol>

<li>
In order to simplify the DB Java API, the type of the <b>flags</b> argument
to the three functions memp_fget(), memp_fput() and memp_fset() has been
changed from ``unsigned long'' to ``int''.
It's possible, although unlikely, that this change could result in compiler
errors for DB applications on some systems, if the flags were stored in a
local variable.
To fix any such errors, change the type of the local variable from
``unsigned long'' to ``int'' and recompile the application.
