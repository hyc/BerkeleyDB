<h1 align=center>Berkeley DB 2.6.7 Change Log</h1>

<p>
Berkeley DB version 2.6.7 is version 2.6.6 with all released patches
applied.

<p>
Berkeley DB version 2.6.7 is the current stable release of Berkeley DB,
replacing version 2.6.6.

<h3>Bug Fixes:</h3>
<ol>
<p><li>
If there are a sufficient number of threads competing for limited numbers
of pages, it's possible to split Btree pages too many times, and cause a
core dump.
<p><li>
Under some circumstances, lockers could be left on locker chains.
No incorrect behavior could occur but resources could be leaked.
<p><li>
Fix potential races in updating checkpoint buffer counts that can
cause checkpoint calls to never finish.
<p><li>
Fix a potential NULL pointer dereference in the database delete-by-key
interface.
<p><li>
Fix a case where it was possible for EAGAIN to not be returned from the
database get-by-key interface.
<p><li>
Ignore log records not involved in transactions so that actions taken
outside of transactions are not undone during recovery.
<p><li>
Fix a recovery bug when database files are opened/closed multiple times in
the same session.
<p><li>
Fix a memory pool race during buffer discard in memory tight environments.
</ol>

<h3>Other Changes:</h3>
<ol>
<p><li>
Update the Berkeley DB release version numbers from 2.6.6 to 2.6.7.
</ol>
