<h1 align=center>Selecting a page size</h1>
<p>
The size of the pages used in the underlying database can be specified by
calling the <a href="../../api_c/db_set_pagesize.html">DB-&gt;set_pagesize</a> function.
The minimum page size is 512 bytes and the maximum page size is 64K bytes,
and must be a power of two.  If no page size is specified by the
application, a page size is selected based on the underlying filesystem
I/O block size. The selected size has a lower limit of 512 bytes and an
upper limit of 16K bytes.
<p>
There are three issues to consider when selecting a pagesize.  First, the
page size implicitly sets the size of an <b>overflow record</b>.
Overflow records are either key or data items that cannot be place on a
normal database page because of their size, and are therefore stored in
overflow pages.  Overflow pages are pages that exist outside of the normal
database structure.  For this reason, there is often a significant
performance penalty associated with retrieving or modifying overflow
records.  Selecting a page size that is too small, and which forces the
creation of a large number of overflow pages, can seriously impact the
performance of your application.
<p>
Second, the finest-grained lock that Berkeley DB acquires is on a page, not on
a record on a page.  Selecting a page size that is too large, and which
causes threads or processes to wait because other threads of control are
accessing or modifying records on the same page, can impact the
performance of your application.
<p>
Third, the page size specifies the granularity of I/O from the database
to the operating system.  Berkeley DB will give a page-sized unit of bytes to
the operating system to be scheduled for writing to the disk.  For most
operating systems, there is an internal <b>block size</b> which is used
as the granularity of I/O from the operating system to the disk.  If the
page size is smaller than the block size, the operating system may be
forced to read a block from the disk, copy the page into the buffer it
read, and then write out the block to disk.  Obviously, it will be much
more efficient for Berkeley DB to write whole blocks to the operating system
and for the operating system to write the same blocks to the disk.
Selecting a page size that is too small, and which causes the operating
system to coalesce or otherwise manipulate Berkeley DB pages, can impact the
performance of your application.  Alternatively, selecting a page size
that is too large may cause Berkeley DB and the operating system to write more
data than is strictly necessary.
