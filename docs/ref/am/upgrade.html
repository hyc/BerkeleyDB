<h1 align=center>Upgrading databases</h1>
<p>When upgrading to a new release of Berkeley DB, it may be necessary to upgrade
the on-disk format of already-created database files.
<p><b>It is important to realize that Berkeley DB database upgrades are done in place,
and so are potentially destructive.</b>  This means that if the system
crashes during the upgrade procedure, or if the upgrade procedure runs
out of disk space, the databases may be left in an inconsistent and
unrecoverable state.
<p>To guard against failure, the following procedure should be followed:
<p><ol>
<p><li>Cleanly shutdown database operations.
<p>To cleanly shutdown database operations, all applications accessing the
database environment must be shutdown and a transaction checkpoint must
be taken.  If the applications are not implemented such that they can be
shutdown gracefully (i.e., closing all references to the database
environment and taking a database checkpoint), recovery must be performed
after all applications have been killed to ensure that the underlying
databases are consistent and up-to-date on disk.
<p><li>Archive the database for catastrophic recovery.  See
<a href="../../ref/transapp/archival.html">Archival procedures</a> for more
information.
<p><li>Upgrade the database using the <a href="../../api_c/db_upgrade.html">DB-&gt;upgrade</a> method, or by dumping
the database using the old version of the Berkeley DB software and reloading it
using the current version.  If this process fails for any reason, use the
catastrophic recovery archive to restore the database.
<p><li>Archive the database for catastrophic recovery again (using different
media than before, of course).
<p>This archival is not strictly necessary.  However, if you have to perform
catastrophic recovery after restarting your applications, that recovery
must be done based on the last archive you have made.  If you make this
archive, you can use it as the basis of your catastrophic recovery.  If
you do not make this archive, you will have to use the archive you made
in step #2 as the basis of your recovery, and you will have to upgrade it
as described in step #3 before you can apply your log files to it.
<p><li>Restart database applications.
</ol>
<p>After an upgrade, Berkeley DB applications must be recompiled to use the new
Berkeley DB library before they access an upgraded database.  <b>There is
no guarantee that applications compiled against previous releases of Berkeley DB
will work correctly with an upgraded database format.  Nor is there any
guarantee that applications compiled against newer releases of Berkeley DB will
work correctly with the previous database format.</b> We do guarantee that
any archived database may be upgraded using a current Berkeley DB software
release and the <a href="../../api_c/db_upgrade.html">DB-&gt;upgrade</a> method, and there is no need to
step-wise upgrade the database using intermediate releases of Berkeley DB.
Sites should consider archiving appropriate copies of their application
or application sources if they may need to access archived databases
without first upgrading them.
