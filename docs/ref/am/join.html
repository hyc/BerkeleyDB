<h1 align=center>Logical join</h1>
<p>
A logical join is a method of retrieving data from a primary database
using criteria stored in a set of secondary databases.  A logical join
requires that your data be organized as a primary database which contains
the primary key and primary data field, and a set of secondary databases.
Each of the secondary databases is indexed by a different secondary key,
and, for each key in a secondary database, there is a set of duplicate
data items that match the primary keys in the primary database.
<p>
For example, consider a database that lists types of fruit as the key
item, and the store where you can buy them as the data item:
<p>
<blockquote><pre><b>Key:</b>		<b>Data:</b>
apple		Convenience Store
peach		Shopway
pear		Farmer's Market
raspberry	Shopway
strawberry	Farmer's Market
blueberry	Farmer's Market</pre></blockquote>
<p>
A secondary index might have a key <b>color</b>, and, as the data items,
the list of fruits of different colors.
<p>
<blockquote><pre><b>Key:</b>		<b>Data:</b>
red		apple, raspberry, strawberry
yellow		peach, pear
blue		blueberry</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This secondary index would allow an application to look up a color, and
then use the data items to look up the stores where the colored fruit
could be purchased.  For example, by first looking up <b>blue</b>, the
data item <b>blueberry</b> could be used as the lookup key in the
primary database, returning <b>Farmer's Market</b>.
<p>
If there were a another secondary index that had as its key the
<b>cost</b> of the fruit, a similar lookup could be done on stores
where inexpensive fruit could be purchased:
<p>
<blockquote><pre><b>Key:</b>		<b>Data:</b>
expensive	blueberry, peach, pear, strawberry
inexpensive	apple, pear, raspberry</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The <a href="../../api_c/db_join.html">DB-&gt;join</a> function provides logical join functionality.  While not
strictly cursor functionality, in that it is not a method off a cursor
handle, it is more related to the cursor operations than to the standard
DB operations.
<p>
What the <a href="../../api_c/db_join.html">DB-&gt;join</a> function does is review a list of secondary keys, and,
when it finds a data item that appears as a data item for all of the
secondary keys, it uses that data items as a lookup into the primary
database, and returns the associated data item.
The <a href="../../api_c/db_join.html">DB-&gt;join</a> function, makes it possible to do lookups based on multiple
criteria in a single operation, e.g., it would be possible to look up
fruits that were both red and expensive in a single operation.  If the
same fruit appeared as a data item in both the color and expense indices,
then that fruit name would be used as the key for retrieval from the
primary index, and would then return the store where expensive, red fruit
could be purchased.
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
Consider the following three databases:
<p>
<dl compact>
<p><dt>personnel<dd><ul type=disc>
<li>key = SSN
<li>data = record containing name, address, phone number, job title
</ul>
<p><dt>lastname<dd><ul type=disc>
<li>key = lastname
<li>data = SSN
</ul>
<p><dt>jobs<dd><ul type=disc>
<li>key = job title
<li>data = SSN
</ul>
</dl>
<p>
Consider the following query:
<p>
<blockquote><pre>Return the personnel records of all smiths who are managers.</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This query finds are all the records in the primary database (personnel)
for whom the criteria <b>lastname=smith and job title=manager</b> is
true.
<p>
Assume that all databases have been properly opened and have the handles:
pers_db, name_db, job_db.  We also assume that we have an active
transaction referenced by the handle txn.
<blockquote><pre>DBC *name_curs, *job_curs, *join_curs;
DBC *carray[3];
DBT key, data;
int ret, tret;
<p>
name_curs = NULL;
job_curs = NULL;
memset(&key, 0, sizeof(key));
memset(&data, 0, sizeof(data));
<p>
if ((ret =
	name_db-&gt;cursor(name_db, txn, &name_curs)) != 0)
		goto err;
key.data = "smith";
key.size = sizeof("smith");
if ((ret =
	name_curs-&gt;c_get(name_curs, &key, &data, DB_SET)) != 0)
		goto err;
<p>
if ((ret = job_db-&gt;cursor(job_db, txn, &job_curs)) != 0)
	goto err;
key.data = "manager";
key.size = sizeof("manager");
if ((ret =
	job_curs-&gt;c_get(job_curs, &key, &data, DB_SET)) != 0)
		goto err;
<p>
carray[0] = name_curs;
carray[1] = job_curs;
carray[2] = NULL;
<p>
if ((ret =
	pers_db-&gt;join(pers_db, carray, 0, &join_curs)) != 0)
		goto err;
<p>
while ((ret =
	join_curs-&gt;c_get(join_curs, &key, &data, 0)) == 0) {
		/* Process record returned in key/data. */
}
<p>
/*
 * If we exited the loop because we ran out of records,
 * then it has completed successfully.
 */
if (ret == DB_NOTFOUND)
	ret = 0;
<p>
err:
if (join_curs != NULL &&
	(tret = join_curs-&gt;c_close(join_curs)) != 0 &&
	ret == 0)
		ret = tret;
if (name_curs != NULL &&
	(tret = name_curs-&gt;c_close(name_curs)) != 0 &&
	ret == 0)
		ret = tret;
if (job_curs != NULL &&
	(tret = job_curs-&gt;c_close(job_curs)) != 0 &&
	ret == 0)
		ret = tret;
return (ret);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The name cursor is placed at the beginning of the duplicate list for
<b>smith</b> and the job cursor is placed at the beginning of the
duplicate list for <b>manager</b>.  The join cursor is returned
from the logical join call.  This code then loops over the join cursor
getting the personnel records of each one until there are no more.
