<h1 align=center>Tcl error handling</h1>
<p>
The Tcl interfaces to Berkeley DB generally return TCL_OK on success and throw
a Tcl error on failure, using the appropriate Tcl interfaces to provide
the user with an informative error message.  There are some "expected"
failures, however, for which no Tcl error will be thrown and for which
Tcl commands will return TCL_OK.  These failures include when a
searched-for key is not found, a requested key/data pair was previously
deleted, or a key/data pair cannot be written because the key already
exists.
<p>
These failures can be detected by searching the Berkeley DB error message that
is returned.  For example, to detect that an attempt to put a record into
the database failed because the key already existed:
<p>
<blockquote><pre>% berkdb open -create -btree a.db
db0
% db0 put dog cat
0
% set ret db0 put -nooverwrite dog newcat
DB_KEYEXIST: Key/data pair already exists
% if { string first DB_KEYEXIST $ret != -1 } {
	puts "This was an error; the key existed"
}
This was an error; the key existed
% db0 close
0
% exit</pre></blockquote>
<p>
To simplify parsing, it is recommended that the initial Berkeley DB error name
be checked, e.g., DB_KEYEXIST in the above example.  These values will
not change in future releases of Berkeley DB to ensure that Tcl scripts are not
broken by upgrading to new releases of Berkeley DB.  There are currently only
three such "expected" error returns.  They are:
<p>
<blockquote><pre>DB_NOTFOUND: No matching key/data pair found
DB_KEYEMPTY: Non-existent key/data pair
DB_KEYEXIST: Key/data pair already exists</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Finally, in some cases, when a Berkeley DB error occurs Berkeley DB will output
additional error information.  The two calls to open an environment and
open a database take an option, <b>-errfile filename</b>, which sets an
output file to which these additional error messages should be written.
All Berkeley DB error messages will be prefixed with the created command in
whose context the error occurred (e.g., "env0", "db2", etc.)
