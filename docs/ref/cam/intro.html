<h1 align=center>Building Berkeley DB Concurrent Data Store applications</h1>
<p>
It is often desirable to have concurrent read-write access to a database
when there is no need for full recoverability or transaction semantics.
For this class of applications, Berkeley DB provides an interface supporting
multiple-reader/single writer access to the database.  This means that,
at any instant in time, there may be either multiple readers accessing
data or a single writer modifying data.  The application is entirely
unaware of which is happening, and Berkeley DB implements the necessary locking
and blocking to ensure this behavior.
<p>
In order to create Berkeley DB Concurrent Data Store applications, you must first initialize an
environment by calling <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html">DBENV-&gt;open</a>.  You must specify the
<a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_INIT_CDB">DB_INIT_CDB</a> flag to that interface and you may also specify the
<a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_INIT_MPOOL">DB_INIT_MPOOL</a> flag (if there is a need for a public memory pool).
It is an error to specify any of the other <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html">DBENV-&gt;open</a> subsystem
or recovery configuration flags, e.g., <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_INIT_LOCK">DB_INIT_LOCK</a>,
<a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_INIT_TXN">DB_INIT_TXN</a> or <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_RECOVER">DB_RECOVER</a>.
<p>
All databases must, of course, be created in this environment, by using
the <a href="../../api_c/db_create.html">db_create</a> interface and specifying the correct environment
as an argument.
<p>
The Berkeley DB access method calls used to support concurrent access are
unchanged from the normal access method calls, with one exception: the
<a href="../../api_c/db_cursor.html">DB-&gt;cursor</a> interface.  In Berkeley DB Concurrent Data Store, each cursor must encapsulate
the idea of being used for read-only access or for read-write access.
There may only be one read-write cursor active at any one time.  When your
application creates a cursor, if that cursor will ever be used for
writing, the <a href="../../api_c/dbc_get.html#DB_WRITECURSOR">DB_WRITECURSOR</a> flag must be specified when the cursor
is created.
<p>
Only a single thread of control may write the database at a time.
Therefore, care must be taken to ensure that applications do not
inadvertently block themselves.  Some common mistakes are:
<ol>
<p><li>Leaving a cursor open while issuing a <a href="../../api_c/db_put.html">DB-&gt;put</a> or <a href="../../api_c/db_del.html">DB-&gt;del</a>
access method call.
<p><li>Attempting to open a cursor for read-write access while already holding
a cursor open for read-write access.
<p><li>Not testing Berkeley DB error return codes (if any cursor operation returns an
unexpected error, that cursor should be closed).
</ol>
<p>
Note that it is correct operation for two different threads of control
(actual threads or processes) to have multiple read-write cursors open,
or for one thread to issue a <a href="../../api_c/db_put.html">DB-&gt;put</a> call while another thread
has a read-write cursor open, and it is only a problem if these things
are done within a single thread of control.
