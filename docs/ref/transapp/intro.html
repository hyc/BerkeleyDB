<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Transaction Protected Applications</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Introduction</h1>
<p>
So far, this Reference Guide has discussed how applications can use the
Berkeley DB Access Methods to store and retrieve data items to and from
database files.  This chapter will discuss how to write
applications to include transactional support.  First, there are a few
terms that will be helpful:
<dl compact>
<p><dt>System or application failure<dd>This is the phrase that we will use to describe when something bad happens
near your data.  It can be an application dumping core, being interrupted
by a signal, the disk filling up, or the entire system crashing.  In any
case, for whatever reason, the application can no longer continue to make
forward progress.
<p><dt>Transaction<dd>A transaction is a group of changes, to one or more databases, that
should be treated as a single unit of work.  That is, either all of
the changes must be applied to the database(s) or none of them
should.  The
application specifies when each transaction starts, what database changes
are included in it, and when it ends.
<p><dt>Transaction commit<dd>Every transaction ends by <i>committing</i> or <i>aborting</i>.
If a transaction commits, then Berkeley DB guarantees that the database changes
inside it will never be lost, even after system or application failure.
If a transaction aborts, or is unfinished when the system or application
fails, then the changes involved will never appear in the database.
<p><dt>Deadlock<dd>Deadlock, in its simplest form, happens when one thread of control owns
resource A, but needs resource B, while another thread of control owns
resource B, but needs resource A.  Neither thread of control can make
progress, and so one has to give up and release all of its resources,
at which point the other can again make forward progress.
<p><dt>Recovery<dd>Whenever system or application failure occurs, the application must run
recovery.  Recovery is what makes the database consistent, i.e., reviews
the log files and the databases to ensure that the changes from each
committed transaction appear in the database, and that none of the
changes from any unfinished (or aborted) transactions do.
<p>
To run recovery, all applications in the environment must exit Berkeley DB.
(Normally, and always, of course, in the case of system failure, the
applications will stop running entirely.)
<p>
Once none of the applications are still using the database environment,
recovery is performed by calling the Berkeley DB interface with
special flags (either <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_RECOVER">DB_RECOVER</a> or <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_RECOVER_FATAL">DB_RECOVER_FATAL</a>).
<p>
When recovery is complete, the database environment is again available
for normal use.
<p><dt>Write-ahead-logging<dd>This is a term that describes the underlying implementation that Berkeley DB
uses to ensure recovery.  What it means is that before any change is
made to a database, information about the change is written to the database
log.  During recovery, the log is read, and databases are checked to ensure
that changes described in the log for committed transactions appear in the
database.  Changes that appear in the database but which are related to
aborted or unfinished transactions in the log are undone from the database.
</dl>
<p>
There are a number of reasons for using transactional support in your
programs.  The most common are:
<dl compact>
<p><dt>Recoverability<dd>Applications often need to ensure that, no matter how the system or
application fails, previously saved data is available the next time the
application runs.
<p><dt>Deadlock avoidance<dd>When multiple threads of control are changing the database at the same
time, there is usually the possibility of deadlock.  The way this is
resolved is that one of the transactions involved has to release the
resources it owns so that the other one can proceed.  (The transaction
that releases its resources is usually just tried again later.) However,
using transactions is necessary so that any changes that have already been
made to the database can be undone, so that the database doesn't end up
corrupted.
<p><dt>Atomicity<dd>Applications often need to make multiple changes, but want to ensure that
either all of the changes happen, or none of them.  Transactions guarantee
that a group of changes are atomic, i.e., that if the application or
system fails, either all of the changes will appear when the application
next runs, or none of them.
<p><dt>Repeatable reads<dd>Applications sometimes need to ensure that, while doing a group of
operations on a database, that the value returned as a result of a
database retrieval doesn't change, i.e., if you retrieve the same key
more than once, the data item will be the same each time.  Transactions
guarantee this behavior.
