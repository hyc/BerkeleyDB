<h1 align=center>Building transaction protected routines</h1>
<p>Consider an application suite where multiple threads of control (multiple
processes or threads in one or more processes) are changing the values
associated with a key in one or more databases.  Specifically, they are
taking the current value, incrementing it, and then storing it back into
the database.  There are two reasons that such an application needs
transactions (other than the obvious requirement of recoverability after
application or system failure):
<p>The first reason for transactions is that the application needs atomicity.
Since we want to change a value in the database, we must make sure that
once we read it, no other thread of control modifies it.  For example,
assume that both thread #1 and thread #2 are doing similar operations in
the database, where thread #1 is incrementing records by 3, and thread #2
is incrementing records by 5.  We want to increment the record by a total
of 8.  If the operations interleave in the right (well, wrong) order, that
is not what will happen:
<p><blockquote><pre>thread #1  <b>read</b> record: the value is 2
thread #2  <b>read</b> record: the value is 2
thread #2  <b>write</b> record + 5 back into the database (new value 7)
thread #1  <b>write</b> record + 3 back into the database (new value 5)</pre></blockquote>
<p>As you can see, instead of incrementing the record by a total of 8, we've
only incremented it by 3, because thread #1 overwrote thread #2's
change.  By wrapping the operations in transactions, we ensure that this
cannot happen.  In a transaction, when the first thread reads the record,
locks are acquired that will not be released until the transaction
finishes, guaranteeing that all other readers and writers will block,
waiting for the first thread's transaction to complete (or to be aborted).
<p>The second reason for transactions is that when multiple processes or
threads of control are modifying the database, there is the potential for
deadlock.  In Berkeley DB, deadlock is signified by an error return from the
Berkeley DB function of <a href="../../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK">DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK</a>.
<p>Here is an example function that does transaction-protected increments on
database records.
<p><blockquote><pre>void
increment(dbenv, dbp, key, increment)
	DB_ENV *dbenv;
	DB *dbp;
	DBT *key;
	int increment;
{
	DBT data;
	DB_TXN *tid;
	int ret;
	char buf[64];
<p>
	/* Initialization. */
	memset(&data, 0, sizeof(data));
<p>
	/* Abort and retry the modification. */
	if (0) {
retry:		if ((ret = txn_abort(tid)) != 0)
			dbenv-&gt;err(dbenv, ret, "txn_abort");
		/* FALLTHROUGH */
	}
<p>
	/* Begin the transaction. */
	if ((ret = txn_begin(dbenv, NULL, &tid, 0)) != 0)
		dbenv-&gt;err(dbenv, ret, "txn_begin");
<p>
	/* Get the key. */
	switch (ret = dbp-&gt;get(dbp, tid, key, &data, 0)) {
	case DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK:
		goto retry;
	case 0:
		break;
	case DB_NOTFOUND:
		if (txn_commit(tid, 0))
			dbenv-&gt;err(dbenv, ret, "txn_commit");
		return (0);
	}
<p>
	/* Get the current value, add the increment. */
	(void)sprintf(buf, "%d", atoi(data.data) + increment);
	data.data = buf;
	data.size = strlen(buf) + 1;
<p>
	/* Store the new value. */
	switch (ret = dbp-&gt;put(dbp, tid, key, &data, 0)) {
	case DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK:
		goto retry;
	case 0:
		break;
	default:
		(void)txn_abort(tid);
		dbenv-&gt;err(dbenv, ret, "dbp-&gt;put");
	}
<p>
	/* The transaction finished, commit it. */
	if ((ret = txn_commit(tid, 0)) != 0)
		dbenv-&gt;err(dbenv, ret, "txn_commit");
<p>
	return (0);
}</pre></blockquote>
<p>In applications supporting transactions, all Berkeley DB functions have an
additional possible error return: <a href="../../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK">DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK</a>.  In the sample
code, any time the Berkeley DB function returns <a href="../../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK">DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK</a>, the
transaction is aborted (by calling <a href="../../api_c/txn_abort.html">txn_abort</a>, which releases all
of its resources), and then the transaction is retried from the beginning.
There is no requirement that the transaction be attempted again, but that
is the common course of action for an application.
