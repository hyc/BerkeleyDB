<h1 align=center>Performing Checkpoints</h1>
<p>The second component of the infrastructure is performing checkpoints of
the log files.  As transactions commit, records are written into the log
files, but the actual changes to the database may not be written to disk.
When a checkpoint is performed, the changes to the database which are part
of committed transactions are written into the database.
<p>Performing checkpoints is necessary for two reasons.  First, you can only
remove the Berkeley DB log files from your system after a checkpoint.  Second,
the frequency of your checkpoints is inversely proportional to the amount
of time it takes to run database recovery after a system or application
failure.
<p>Once the database pages are written, log files can be archived and removed
from the system because they will never be needed for anything other than
catastrophic failure.  In addition, recovery after system or application
failure only has to redo or undo changes since the last checkpoint, since
changes before the checkpoint have all been flushed to the filesystem.
<p>Berkeley DB provides a separate UNIX-style utility, named <a href="../../utility/db_checkpoint.html">db_checkpoint</a>,
which can be used to perform checkpoints.  Alternatively, applications
can write their own checkpoint utility using the underlying
<a href="../../api_c/txn_checkpoint.html">txn_checkpoint</a> function.
<p>As checkpoints can be quite expensive, choosing how often to perform a
checkpoint is a common tuning parameter for Berkeley DB applications.
