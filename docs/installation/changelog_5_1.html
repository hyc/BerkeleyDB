 Fixed a bug which would occur when recovery checkpoint was not written because the cache ran out of space attempting to flush the memory pool cache. The environment would be recovered and all database where made available, but some databases would incorrectly closed. This would cause a subsequent recovery to fail on its backward pass with the error "PANIC: No such file or directory". [#18590]

 Fixed a bug that could cause recovery to fail with the error "DB_LOGC-&gt;get: log record LSN %u/%u: checksum mismatch" if the last log file was nearly full and ended with a partially written log record which was smaller than a checkpoint record. It now erases the invalid partial record before switching to the new log file. [#18651]

 Two new |BigDecimal| formats have been added. One format supports default natural sorting. The other format is unsorted, but has other advantages: trailing zeros after the decimal place are preserved, and a more compact, faster serialization format is used.

 Replication Manager now uses the standard system implementation of getaddrinfo() when running on Windows, which means that it can support IPv6 addresses if support is present and configured in the operating system.  [#18263]

 Fixed a bug which could occur when using bulk transfer with Replication Manager.  When closing a DB_ENV handle, any remaining bulk buffer contents are flushed, and Replication Manager could have tried to send the resulting messages even though its connections had already been closed, leading in rare circumstances to spurious EBADF error reports, or possibly even arbitrary memory corruption.

 Fixed a bug which caused Replication Manager to wait for acknowledgement from client, even if it had failed to send a log record, due to "queue limit exceeded".  Replication Manager now returns immediately, with a PERM_FAILED indication, to avoid a pointless delay to the commit() operation.  [#18682]

 Fixed a race condition that was causing the error:  "Unable to allocate space from the buffer cache".  The error can only be triggered when multiple memory pool regions are used and there is a periodic gathering and clearing of statistics. This also fixes a second bug where if you compile without statistics and explicitly set the memoru pool default pagesize, other environment handles to that environment would not see the correct memory pool default pagesize.

 Fixed problems with the printed statistics for DB_MUTEX_SHARED latches. The DB_STAT_CLEAR flag (as specified by db_stat -Z) did not clear the counts of the number of times a shared latch either had to wait to get access or was able to get the latch without waiting.

 Modified the db_printlog and db_dump -da so that they use the same formatting. The db_logprint utility now uses the message stream.
