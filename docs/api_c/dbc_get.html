DBcursor-&gt;c_get(DBC *cursor,

</pre></h3>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
The DBcursor-&gt;c_get function retrieves key/data pairs from the database.  The
address
and length of the key are returned in the object referenced by <b>key</b>
(except for the case of the DB_SET flag where the <b>key</b>
object is unchanged), and the
address
and length of the data are returned in the object referenced by <b>data</b>.
<p>
Modifications to the database during a sequential scan will be reflected
in the scan, i.e. records inserted behind a cursor will not be returned
while records inserted in front of a cursor will be returned.
<p>
In Queue and Recno databases, missing entries (i.e., entries that were
never explicitly created or that were created and then deleted), will be
skipped during a sequential scan.
<p>
If multiple threads or processes insert items into the same database file
without using locking, the results are undefined.
For more detail,
see <a href="../ref/txn/stability.html">cursor stability</a>.
<p>
The <b>flags</b> parameter must be set to one of the following values:
<dl compact>
<p><dt><a name="DB_CONSUME">DB_CONSUME</a><dd>Return the record number and data from the available record closest to
the head of the queue and delete the record.  The cursor will be
positioned on the deleted record.  The record number will be returned in
<b>key</b> as described in <a href="../api_c/dbt.html">DBT</a>.  The data will be returned in
the <b>data</b> parameter.
<p>
A record is available if it is not deleted and is not currently locked.
For DB_CONSUME to be specified, the underlying database must be
of type Queue.
<p><dt><a name="DB_CURRENT">DB_CURRENT</a><dd>Return the key/data pair currently referenced by the cursor.
<p>
If the cursor key/data pair was deleted, DBcursor-&gt;c_get will return
<a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_KEYEMPTY">DB_KEYEMPTY</a>.
<p>
If the cursor is not yet initialized, the DBcursor-&gt;c_get
function will return EINVAL.
<p><dt><a name="DB_FIRST">DB_FIRST</a><dd>The cursor is set to reference the first key/data pair of the database,
and that pair is returned.
In the presence of duplicate key values,
the first data item in the set of duplicates is returned.
<p>
If the database is a Queue or Recno database, DBcursor-&gt;c_get using the
DB_FIRST flag will skip any keys that exist but were never
explicitly created by the application or were created and later deleted.
<p>
If the database is empty, DBcursor-&gt;c_get will return <a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_NOTFOUND">DB_NOTFOUND</a>.
<p><dt><a name="DB_GET_BOTH">DB_GET_BOTH</a><dd>The DB_GET_BOTH flag is identical to the DB_SET flag,
except that both the key and the data arguments must be matched by the
key and data item in the database.
<p>
For DB_GET_BOTH to be specified, the underlying database must be
of type Btree or Hash.
<p><dt><a name="DB_GET_RECNO">DB_GET_RECNO</a><dd>Return the record number associated with the cursor.  The record number
will be returned in <b>data</b> as described in <a href="../api_c/dbt.html">DBT</a>.  The
<b>key</b> parameter is ignored.
<p>
For DB_GET_RECNO to be specified, the underlying database must be
of type Btree and it must have been created with the <a href="../api_c/db_set_flags.html#DB_RECNUM">DB_RECNUM</a>
flag.
<p><dt><a name="DB_JOIN_ITEM">DB_JOIN_ITEM</a><dd>Do not use the data value found in all of the cursors as a lookup key for
the primary database, but simply return it in the key parameter instead.
The data parameter is left unchanged.
<p>
For DB_JOIN_ITEM to be specified, the underlying cursor must have
been returned from the <a href="../api_c/db_join.html">DB-&gt;join</a> function.
<p><dt><a name="DB_LAST">DB_LAST</a><dd>The cursor is set to reference the last key/data pair of the database,
and that pair is returned.
In the presence of duplicate key values,
the last data item in the set of duplicates is returned.
<p>
If the database is a Queue or Recno database, DBcursor-&gt;c_get using the
DB_LAST flag will skip any keys that exist but were never
explicitly created by the application or were created and later deleted.
<p>
If the database is empty, DBcursor-&gt;c_get will return <a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_NOTFOUND">DB_NOTFOUND</a>.
<p><dt><a name="DB_NEXT">DB_NEXT</a><dd>If the cursor is not yet initialized, DB_NEXT is identical to
DB_FIRST.
<p>
Otherwise, the cursor is moved to the next key/data pair of the database,
and that pair is returned.
In the presence of duplicate key values, the value of the key may not change.
<p>
If the database is a Queue or Recno database, DBcursor-&gt;c_get using the
DB_NEXT flag will skip any keys that exist but were never
explicitly created by the application or were created and later deleted.
<p>
If the cursor is already on the last record in the database, DBcursor-&gt;c_get
will return <a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_NOTFOUND">DB_NOTFOUND</a>.
<p><dt><a name="DB_NEXT_DUP">DB_NEXT_DUP</a><dd>If the next key/data pair of the database is a duplicate record for the
current key/data pair, the cursor is moved to the next key/data pair of
the database, and that pair is returned.
Otherwise, DBcursor-&gt;c_get will return <a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_NOTFOUND">DB_NOTFOUND</a>.
<p>
If the cursor is not yet initialized, the DBcursor-&gt;c_get
function will return EINVAL.
<p><dt><a name="DB_PREV">DB_PREV</a><dd>If the cursor is not yet initialized, DB_PREV is identical to
DB_LAST.
<p>
Otherwise, the cursor is moved to the previous key/data pair of the database,
and that pair is returned.
In the presence of duplicate key values, the value of the key may not change.
<p>
If the database is a Queue or Recno database, DBcursor-&gt;c_get using the
DB_PREV flag will skip any keys that exist but were never
explicitly created by the application or were created and later deleted.
<p>
If the cursor is already on the first record in the database, DBcursor-&gt;c_get
will return <a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_NOTFOUND">DB_NOTFOUND</a>.
<p><dt><a name="DB_SET">DB_SET</a><dd>Move the cursor to the specified key/data pair of the database, and
return the datum associated with the given key.
<p>
In the presence of duplicate key values, DBcursor-&gt;c_get will return the
first data item for the given key.
<p>
If the database is a Queue or Recno database and the requested key exists,
but was never explicitly created by the application or was later deleted,
DBcursor-&gt;c_get will return <a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_KEYEMPTY">DB_KEYEMPTY</a>.
<p>
If no matching keys are found, DBcursor-&gt;c_get will return
<a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_NOTFOUND">DB_NOTFOUND</a>.
<p><dt><a name="DB_SET_RANGE">DB_SET_RANGE</a><dd>The DB_SET_RANGE flag is identical to the DB_SET flag,
except that the key is returned as well as the data item, and, in the case
of the Btree access method, the returned key/data pair is the smallest
key greater than or equal to the specified key (as determined by the
comparison function), permitting partial key matches and range
searches.
<p><dt><a name="DB_SET_RECNO">DB_SET_RECNO</a><dd>Move the cursor to the specific numbered record of the database, and
return the associated key/data pair.  The <b>data</b> field of the
specified <b>key</b>
must be a pointer to a memory location from which a <a href="../api_c/dbt.html#db_recno_t">db_recno_t</a>
may be read, as described in <a href="../api_c/dbt.html">DBT</a>.  This memory location will be
read to determine the record to be retrieved.
<p>
For DB_SET_RECNO to be specified, the underlying database must be
of type Btree and it must have been created with the <a href="../api_c/db_set_flags.html#DB_RECNUM">DB_RECNUM</a>
flag.
</dl>
<p>
In addition, the following value may be set by bitwise inclusively <b>OR</b>'ing it into the
<b>flags</b> parameter:
<dl compact>
<p><dt><a name="DB_RMW">DB_RMW</a><dd>Acquire write locks instead of read locks when doing the retrieval.
Setting this flag may decrease the likelihood of deadlock during a
read-modify-write cycle by immediately acquiring the write lock during
the read part of the cycle so that another thread of control acquiring
a read lock for the same item, in its own read-modify-write cycle, will
not result in deadlock.
</dl>
<p>
Otherwise, the DBcursor-&gt;c_get
function returns a non-zero error value on failure and 0 on success.
<p>
If DBcursor-&gt;c_get fails for any reason, the state of the cursor will be
unchanged.
<p>
<h1>Errors</h1>
If a fatal error occurs in Berkeley DB, the DBcursor-&gt;c_get function will fail and return
<a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_RUNRECOVERY">DB_RUNRECOVERY</a>, at which point all subsequent database calls will
fail in the same way.
<p>
In addition, the DBcursor-&gt;c_get
function may fail and return a non-zero error
for the following conditions:
<p>
<dl compact>
<p><dt>DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK<dd>The operation was selected to resolve a deadlock.
</dl>
<p>
<dl compact>
<p><dt>ENOMEM<dd>There was insufficient memory to return the requested item.
</dl>
<p>
<dl compact>
<p><dt>EINVAL<dd>An invalid flag value or parameter was specified.
<p>
The specified cursor was not currently initialized.
<p>
The <a href="../api_c/env_open.html#DB_THREAD">DB_THREAD</a> flag was specified to <a href="../api_c/db_open.html">DB-&gt;open</a> and none of
the <a href="../api_c/dbt.html#DB_DBT_MALLOC">DB_DBT_MALLOC</a>, <a href="../api_c/dbt.html#DB_DBT_REALLOC">DB_DBT_REALLOC</a> or
<a href="../api_c/dbt.html#DB_DBT_USERMEM">DB_DBT_USERMEM</a> flags were set in the <a href="../api_c/dbt.html">DBT</a>.
</dl>
<p>
In addition, the DBcursor-&gt;c_get function may fail and
return a non-zero error
for errors specified for other Berkeley DB and C library or system functions.
