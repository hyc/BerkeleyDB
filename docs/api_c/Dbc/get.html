<h1>DBcursor->c_get</h1>

<h3>
<pre>

DBcursor->c_get(DBC *cursor,
    DBT *key, DBT *data, u_int32_t flags);

</h3>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
The DBcursor->c_get function retrieves key/data pairs from the database.  The
address
and length of the key are returned in the object referenced by <b>key</b>
(except for the case of the DB_SET flag where the <b>key</b> object is
unchanged), and the
address
and length of the data are returned in the object referenced by <b>data</b>.
<p>
Modifications to the database during a sequential scan will be reflected
in the scan, i.e. records inserted behind a cursor will not be returned
while records inserted in front of a cursor will be returned.
<p>
In Recno databases, missing entries (i.e., entries that were never explicitly
created or that were created and then deleted), will be skipped during a
sequential scan.
<p>
If multiple threads or processes insert items into the same database file
without using locking, the results are undefined.
For more detail,
see <a href="../../ref/txn/stability.html">cursor stability</a>.
<p>
The <b>flags</b> parameter must be set to one of the following values:
<dl compact>
<a name="DB_FIRST">
<p><dt>DB_FIRST<dd>The cursor is set to reference the first key/data pair of the database,
and that pair is returned.
In the presence of duplicate key values,
the first data item in the set of duplicates is returned.
<p>
If the database is a Recno database, DBcursor->c_get using the
DB_FIRST flag will skip any keys that exist but were never
explicitly created by the application or were created and later deleted.
<p>
If the database is empty, DBcursor->c_get will return DB_NOTFOUND.
<a name="DB_LAST">
<p><dt>DB_LAST<dd>The cursor is set to reference the last key/data pair of the database,
and that pair is returned.
In the presence of duplicate key values,
the last data item in the set of duplicates is returned.
<p>
If the database is a Recno database, DBcursor->c_get using the
DB_LAST flag will skip any keys that exist but were never
explicitly created by the application or were created and later deleted.
<p>
If the database is empty, DBcursor->c_get will return DB_NOTFOUND.
<a name="DB_NEXT">
<p><dt>DB_NEXT<dd>If the cursor is not yet initialized, DB_NEXT is identical to DB_FIRST.
<p>
Otherwise, move the cursor to the next key/data pair of the database,
and that pair is returned.
In the presence of duplicate key values, the value of the key may not change.
<p>
If the database is a Recno database, DBcursor->c_get using the
DB_NEXT flag will skip any keys that exist but were never
explicitly created by the application or were created and later deleted.
<p>
If the cursor is already on the last record in the database, DBcursor->c_get
will return DB_NOTFOUND.
<a name="DB_NEXT_DUP">
<p><dt>DB_NEXT_DUP<dd>If the next key/data pair of the database is a duplicate record for the
current key/data pair, move the cursor to the next key/data pair of the
database, and that pair is returned.
Otherwise, DBcursor->c_get will return DB_NOTFOUND.
<p>
If the cursor is not yet initialized, the DBcursor->c_get
function will return EINVAL.
<a name="DB_PREV">
<p><dt>DB_PREV<dd>If the cursor is not yet initialized, DB_PREV is identical to DB_LAST.
<p>
Otherwise, move the cursor to the previous key/data pair of the database,
and that pair is returned.
In the presence of duplicate key values, the value of the key may not change.
<p>
If the database is a Recno database, DBcursor->c_get using the
DB_PREV flag will skip any keys that exist but were never
explicitly created by the application or were created and later deleted.
<p>
If the cursor is already on the first record in the database, DBcursor->c_get
will return DB_NOTFOUND.
<a name="DB_CURRENT">
<p><dt>DB_CURRENT<dd>Return the key/data pair currently referenced by the cursor.
<p>
If the cursor key/data pair was deleted, DBcursor->c_get will return
DB_KEYEMPTY.
<p>
If the cursor is not yet initialized, the DBcursor->c_get
function will return EINVAL.
<a name="DB_SET">
<p><dt>DB_SET<dd>Move the cursor to the specified key/data pair of the database,
and return the datum associated with the given key.
<p>
In the presence of duplicate key values, DBcursor->c_get will return the
first data item for the given key.
<p>
If the database is a Recno database and the requested key exists, but was
never explicitly created by the application or was later deleted,
DBcursor->c_get will return DB_KEYEMPTY.
<p>
If no matching keys are found, DBcursor->c_get will return DB_NOTFOUND.
<a name="DB_SET_RANGE">
<p><dt>DB_SET_RANGE<dd>The DB_SET_RANGE flag is identical to the DB_SET flag, except that the
key is returned as well as the data item, and, in the case of the btree
access method, the returned key/data pair is the smallest key greater than
or equal to the specified key (as determined by the comparison
function), permitting partial key matches and range searches.
<a name="DB_GET_BOTH">
<p><dt>DB_GET_BOTH<dd>The DB_GET_BOTH flag is identical to the DB_SET flag, except that both the
key and the data arguments must be matched by the key and data item in the
database.
<a name="DB_SET_RECNO">
<p><dt>DB_SET_RECNO<dd>Move the cursor to the specific numbered record of the database,
and return the associated key/data pair.
The <b>data</b> field of the specified <b>key</b>
must be a pointer to a memory location from which a <a href="../../api_c/Dbt/dbt.html#db_recno_t">db_recno_t</a>
may be read, as described in DBT.
This memory location will be read to determine the record to be retrieved.
<p>
For DB_SET_RECNO to be specified, the underlying database must be of
type btree and it must have been created with the <a href="../../api_c/DbInfo/info.html#DB_RECNUM">DB_RECNUM</a> flag.
<a name="DB_GET_RECNO">
<p><dt>DB_GET_RECNO<dd>Return the record number associated with the cursor.
The record number will be returned in <b>data</b> as described in
DBT.
The <b>key</b> parameter is ignored.
<p>
For DB_GET_RECNO to be specified, the underlying database must be of
type btree and it must have been created with the <a href="../../api_c/DbInfo/info.html#DB_RECNUM">DB_RECNUM</a> flag.
</dl>
<p>
In addition, the following value may be set by logically <b>OR</b>'ing it into the
<b>flags</b> parameter:
<dl compact>
<p><dt>DB_RMW<dd>Acquire write locks instead of read locks when doing the retrieval.
Setting this flag may decrease the likelihood of deadlock during a
read-modify-write cycle by immediately acquiring the write lock during
the read part of the cycle so that another thread of control acquiring
a read lock for the same item, in its own read-modify-write cycle, will
not result in deadlock.
</dl>
<p>
Otherwise, the DBcursor->c_get
function returns the value of <b>errno</b> on failure, and 0 on success.
<p>
If DBcursor->c_get fails for any reason, the state of the cursor will be
unchanged.
<p>
<h1>Errors</h1>
If a fatal error occurs in Berkeley DB, the DBcursor->c_get function may fail and return
DB_RUNRECOVERY, at which point all subsequent database calls will also
return DB_RUNRECOVERY.
<p>

function may fail and return <b>errno</b>
for any of the errors specified for the following Berkeley DB and C library
functions:
__account_page(3),

for the following conditions:
<p>
<dl compact>
<p><dt>EAGAIN<dd>A lock was unavailable.

<p>
<dl compact>
